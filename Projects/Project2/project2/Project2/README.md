Artist Statement

I felt that I needed to create something that can utilize a junction of what was introduced this semester, therefore, Racer; start! was born. This project will incorporate JQUERY, CSS, and obviously JAVASCRIPT, with many different libraries that was seen throughout the semester. Thus, inspiration for this final project comes from Week 8 of this course, as that specific week gave me an idea of what to make for my final project. The use of adding classes and then removing them gave me the idea of a typeracer game but without the actual racing mechanics, as mentioned in my proposal feedback it would of been too similar to that of the actual typeracer game seen on the internet. Therefore, Racer; Start! was born. In this game, you are required to use your exceptional typing capabilities to type to victory. The game introduces 3 levels which increase in difficulty as you continue to type. I had a similar theme for all the levels which would follow the theme of distraction with the text trying to distract you from typing at an excellent speed, as well as (ResponsiveVoice) acting as the "engineer" of the game. I also implemented annyang for the final level to follow the direction of the hard level being hard, where you need to say random words that are brought up on the screen while typing, while needing to beat the timer on all levels.

Speaking in terms of coding, I felt that the main content of the project was obviously the typing aspect of the project, therefore, I knew I would be needing to start early on this project, so I started during the reading week. Most of that time went into the typing mechanic, so in reality, I spent maybe a majority of my time during that week on that specific aspect of the project.

As illustrated, the main technical process involved when creating the main content of the project was that; I had to figure out how to take an array, randomize the array, using math.random, then split the array into their own <span>'s, then add those <span>'s back onto every character in the array including spaces, then add a start class, correct class and incorrect class, apply those classes to their respective inputs of the key presses. If correct, add 1 onto current index of the current <span> in the array which resides, then move onto the next <span> in the array and apply the start class. If keypressed is wrong to current <span> then apply the incorrect class. Consequently, I believe I achieved my goals both technically and artistically because I had an idea which I stuck with, and continued to build upon that idea using techniques and or content seen throughout the semester.
