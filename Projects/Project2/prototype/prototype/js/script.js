/**
Racer; start!
Anthony Calderone

Prototype: Use your exceptional typing capibilities to race fellow users(AI).
Your character's speed depends on how fast you can type, and with minimal mistakes. The idea comes from the website; https://play.typeracer.com/
I felt that I needed to create something that can utilise a junction of what was introduced this semester, therefore, Racer; start was born.
This project will encoorporate JQUERY, JSON, CSS, and obviously JAVASCRIPT.

-correct word/letters turn green on correct and vice versa with red on wrong
-players move on correct spelling/what kind of movement???
-AI???
-prompt showing up asking which level to type on? easy to impossible with harder sentences + less time to type
-accuracy to the typing? WPM??? CPM???
